                <h2>Short Platform Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    Across Australia's public transport network, <strong>short platforms</strong> are key in shaping station capacity. 
                    There are <strong>175 facilities</strong> with short platforms, mostly in <strong>space-constrained areas</strong> that can't accommodate longer trains. 
                    This impacts service frequency train capacity, and overall system efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short platforms, while needed in some areas, can create bottlenecks in <strong>high-demand regions</strong>. 
                    Upgrading them is key to meeting Australia's growing transport needs.
                </p>

                <h2>New South Wales vs Victoria</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>New South Wales</strong> has <strong>175 short platform facilities</strong>, highlighting potential capacity issues in the state. 
                    In contrast, <strong>Victoria</strong> has <strong>no short platforms</strong>, reflecting a different infrastructure approach to managing capacity 
                    and transport services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New South Wales also features a more <strong>diverse transport network</strong>, with <strong>263 coach facilities</strong> and various combinations 
                    of <strong>train, bus, and ferry</strong> services. <strong>Victoria</strong>, however, has fewer facilities focused primarily on <strong>regional 
                    coach</strong> and <strong>train services</strong>.

                    <h2>Seasonal Trends and Holiday Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>January</strong> consistently shows lower public transport patronage across multiple modes, particularly for the <strong>Train</strong>. This trend is likely influenced 
                        by the <strong>holiday season</strong>, as many people are on vacation or not working during this time. This pattern is also reflected in the <strong>December</strong> numbers, which are 
                        relatively lower due to the lead-up to the holiday period.

                    <h2>Post-COVID Recovery </h2>
                    <p>
                        From <strong>2021</strong> to <strong>2023</strong>, there is a noticeable increase in patronage across all transport modes, including the <strong>Train</strong> and <strong>Regional coach</strong>, 
                        after the sharp decline seen in <strong>2020</strong> during the pandemic lockdowns. For instance, by <strong>July 2023</strong>, the patronage for <strong>Metropolitan train</strong> had risen to <strong>14 million</strong>, 
                        showing a strong recovery as restrictions eased and people returned to regular commuting.

                    <h2>Staff Complaints (2023)</h2>
                    <p>
                      One major observation from the visualization is the significant spike in complaints about 
                      <strong>Behaviour of staff</strong> in <strong>2023</strong>. This category saw a steep surge, 
                      suggesting a rise in tensions between staff and passengers. This could be related to 
                      increasing commuter frustrations or the challenges of post-pandemic service recovery. 
                      Addressing <strong>staff training</strong> and improving<strong> passenger interactions</strong> should be 
                      a <strong>high priority</strong> to improve the overall transport experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The rise may also reflect <strong>higher passenger expectations</strong> post-pandemic. As regular commuting resumes, passengers likely expect better <strong>
                      professionalism</strong> and <strong>service</strong> from staff. Improving customer service could help reduce future complaints.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Rise in Punctuality Complaints</h2>
                    <p>
                        Complaints related to <strong>Punctuality</strong> have seen a gradual rise from 
                        <strong>2016</strong> to <strong>2023</strong>, indicating persistent issues with delays and unreliable services. 
                        The steady increase in complaints about punctuality highlights the need for <strong>better scheduling</strong>, 
                        clearer communication with passengers during delays, and potential infrastructure upgrades
                        to ensure more <strong>reliable service delivery</strong>.

                                    The bus routes across <strong>Victoria</strong> and <strong>New South Wales</strong> highlight the connectivity and public transport reach within these states. 
                                    In <strong>Victoria</strong>, the <strong style="color:red;">red</strong> points represent starting locations, and the 
                                    <strong style="color:blue;">blue</strong> points indicate endpoints, giving a clear understanding of where major routes begin and end. 
                                    In <strong>New South Wales</strong>, a similar pattern is followed with <strong style="color:purple;">purple</strong> points marking the start

                            <p>
                                The tram network in <strong>Victoria</strong> and <strong>New South Wales</strong> is an essential mode of urban transport, especially in densely populated areas. 
                                This map shows the key routes in both states, with a focus on major tram lines that serve busy city centers and surrounding suburbs. 
                                <strong>Victoria</strong>, particularly <strong>Melbourne</strong>, is renowned for having one of the largest tram networks in the world, 
                                facilitating millions of daily commuters. 
                            </p>
