                        This section analyzes the trends in public transport complaints over the years, focusing on identifying key growth patterns and areas where concerns are 
                        concentrated. By looking at fluctuations in complaint numbers, we can determine the specific issues causing dissatisfaction, such as delays, overcrowding, 
                        or inadequate services. Understanding these patterns helps highlight where improvements in service, communication, or infrastructure might be needed to 
                        address customer concerns and enhance overall service quality.

                    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                    <p>
                        This section examines the potential future of public transport services by using historical complaint data to anticipate emerging trends. The analysis 
                        highlights which areas of public transport are likely to need further attention, such as infrastructure upgrades or service expansions. By addressing 
                        recurring issues, policymakers and service providers can plan targeted strategies for improvement. This approach aims to ensure the sustainable development 
                        of public transport services, with a focus on better user experience and operational efficiency in the long term.
