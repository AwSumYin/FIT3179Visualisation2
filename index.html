                <h2>Short Platform Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    Across Australia's public transport network, <strong>short platforms</strong> are key in shaping station capacity. 
                    There are <strong>175 facilities</strong> with short platforms, mostly in <strong>space-constrained areas</strong> that can't accommodate longer trains. 
                    This impacts <strong>service frequency</strong>, <strong>train capacity</strong>, and overall system efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short platforms, while needed in some areas, can create bottlenecks in high-demand regions. 
                    Upgrading them is key to meeting Australia's growing transport needs.
                </p>

                <h2>New South Wales vs Victoria</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>New South Wales</strong> has <strong>175 short platform facilities</strong>, highlighting potential capacity issues in the state. 
                    In contrast, <strong>Victoria</strong> has <strong>no short platforms</strong>, reflecting a different infrastructure approach to managing capacity 
                    and transport services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New South Wales also features a more <strong>diverse transport network</strong>, with <strong>263 coach facilities</strong> and various combinations 
                    of <strong>train, bus, and ferry</strong> services. <strong>Victoria</strong>, however, has fewer facilities focused primarily on <strong>regional 
                    coach</strong> and <strong>train services</strong>.

                        The first part of the story provides an overview of public transport usage trends in Eastern Australia. It highlights the importance of understanding seasonal patterns
                        and the effect of holidays or external events on ridership.

                    <p>
                        This section analyzes the trends in public transport complaints over the years, focusing on identifying key growth patterns and areas where concerns are 
                        concentrated. By looking at fluctuations in complaint numbers, we can determine the specific issues causing dissatisfaction, such as delays, overcrowding, 
                        or inadequate services. Understanding these patterns helps highlight where improvements in service, communication, or infrastructure might be needed to 
                        address customer concerns and enhance overall service quality.

                    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                    <p>
                        This section examines the potential future of public transport services by using historical complaint data to anticipate emerging trends. The analysis 
                        highlights which areas of public transport are likely to need further attention, such as infrastructure upgrades or service expansions. By addressing 
                        recurring issues, policymakers and service providers can plan targeted strategies for improvement. This approach aims to ensure the sustainable development 
                        of public transport services, with a focus on better user experience and operational efficiency in the long term.
